# CSGO-Twitch-viewer-analysis

This repository contains the work done during a Marketing Analysis course.

## Project Description and Executive Summary

The analysis revealed a surge in the number of players during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was accounted for in the regression model by adding a "Covid Flag" column. The impact of major championships on the player count was also analysed by adding a "Majors" column. The effect of the announcement of a new version of the game, "Counter-Strike 2," was analysed by adding a "CS2Flag" column. The correlation between the variables was analysed. The negative correlation between the price of the game and the number of players was also established, as was the positive correlation between the discount and the number of players. The impact of Twitch viewers on player count was analysed using a regression model, and it was found that Twitch viewers had a minimal, but positive effect on the number of players.

Next, a Bass model was constructed, and it was used to find the count of Imitators and Innovators for the game, which came up to be 55.7 and 15.9 million respectively.
The pricing strategy for CS:GO was analysed with the help of competitor data and it was concluded to be efficient in terms of attracting new players.
It was also then found that promotions were not effective for this game since the game had become free-to- play. Other factors have also been looked at and appropriately commented upon.
The report concludes by predicting the players for the next 14 days and plots the same.
